## Variable selection and interaction discovery for chemical mixture data

### TODO:

1. Create a linear model with 5 predictors: $10X_1 - 10X_2 + 5X_1 X_2  + 8X_3 + 6X_3(X_4 - X_5) - 10X_5(1-X_4+X_3X_4)$ (rl)

2. Test our method on Choose(5,1) + Choose(5,2) + Choose(5,3) = 25 possible combinations. See if the correct combination could be identified. Repeat 10 times. (rl)

3. Code for the selection procedure. (bz)
